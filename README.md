# Subtitle_pattern_generator
This Python script provides a utility to generate a subtitle pattern for videos. The script takes as input a text file containing lines of dialogue and their corresponding timestamps. It then formats the text into subtitles with a maximum of 40 characters per line and calculates the start and end times for each subtitle.
