# Subtitle_pattern_generator
This Python script provides a utility to generate a subtitle pattern for videos. The script takes as input a text file containing lines of dialogue and their corresponding timestamps. It then formats the text into subtitles with a maximum of 40 characters per line and calculates the start and end times for each subtitle.
Features:

- Splits the input text into subtitles with a maximum of 40 characters per line
- Calculates the start and end times for each subtitle based on the text length
Handles timestamps in the format "HH:MM:SS,SSS"
- Ensures the generated subtitles do not exceed the specified line length and fit within the given time constraints

Usage:
1 - Provide an input text file with timestamps and dialogue
2 - Run the script to generate a subtitle pattern
3 - Specify the output file to save the generated subtitles

This script is useful for generating subtitle patterns for videos, ensuring that the subtitles are visually pleasing and synchronized with the audio. It can be integrated into video processing pipelines or used as a standalone tool.
